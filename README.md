# Resources for OCEAN GitHub Copilot demonstration

This repository contains resources for the GitHub Copilot demonstration at OCEAN's November 15, 2023 presentation.

## PRIMENUM.RPGLE
Inside this repository you will find *PRIMENUM.RPGLE*, the RPG IV program shown during the demonstration. When run on the command line, the program should receive a number from the user as input, and output whether the number is a prime number; the program checks whether the number is prime using the isPrime procedure declared towards the end of the file. However, the isPrime procedure is deliberately left unfinished; the intention is to use Copilot to complete the procedure as part of the demonstration.

## Tools used during the demonstration
The demonstration utilizes Visual Studio Code, a free code editor, along with a series of extensions that enable VS Code to work with IBM i programs and with Copilot.
VS Code and the below extensions can all be downloaded and installed for free (although the Copilot extensions are useless without a Copilot subscription).
